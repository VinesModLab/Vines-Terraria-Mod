## Mod Idea
I made this mod because I noticed gems (ruby, topaz etc) are seldom used at crafting in game. I want to make a mod that can greatly consume those unused gems.

I designed a overdrive system which allows weapons upgrade, to make the original weapons can catch up in late modded game (500+ atks).

## Background Story
The world collided with other dimension, lead to a new power resource, "overdrive" spawn in the world. This lead to apocalypse, but the god of world break it down into pieces called "shards". Living things who hold them will became stronger, so people start hunting for shards...

Note : It might be released to mod browser after ALL the original terraria sprites have been reworked (I dont want re-colored sprites...). That will be when I finally found someone who can draw...
