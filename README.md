## Mod Idea
I made this mod because I noticed gems (ruby, topaz etc) are seldom used at crafting in game. I want to make a mod that can greatly consume those unused gems.

I designed a overdrive system which allows weapons upgrade, to make the original weapons can catch up in late modded game (500+ atks).

## Things Contained in Mod:
* 20+ New Weapons
* 3+ New Accessories
* 1+ New Set of Armor
* 20+ New Materials
* 5+ New Bosses
* 1+ New NPCs

## Mod Authors
* Codes were written by Vines
